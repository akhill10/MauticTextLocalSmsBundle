## Synopsis

This plugin allows to send SMS messages through TextLocal service provider API.
It is based on the current version of Twilio plugin available in the default Mautic install package, and also on TextLocal plugin for previous Mautic versions written by @abreuleonel .

## Motivation

The lack a of an updated version of the original TextLocal plugin as well as the absence of an alternative to Twilio API was what motivated the creation of this.
